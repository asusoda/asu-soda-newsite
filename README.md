### The Software Developers Association (SoDA)

The Software Developers Association (SoDA) at Arizona State University, is a student run, free organization dedicated to serving ASU’s computer science students. SoDA is one of the largest communities of students on campus, and is the largest engineering organization. We provide opportunities to collaborate on projects outside of the classroom, learn from university and industry professionals, and prepare for a career as a software developer.

# 💻 How to run website locally

The website uses npm, which manages all dependencies and has a dummy server that you can run on your local machine to view the website.

```shell
> cd asu-soda-newsite
> npm i #install all dependencies if this is the first time you are doing this
> npm ci (optional)
> npm run dev
```

The server will refresh the page automatically when you make changes to the code!

# 👨‍💻 Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the `thesoda.io` uses:

- This project uses the [React Lirary](https://react.dev/). React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive experience.
- For build tool, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) provides a fast development experience for web projects. When you use Vite with React, you get a development setup that is both fast and modern. Vite is configured to handle React’s specific needs efficiently, allowing you to focus more on development and less on configuration.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It helps the project catch errors early in the development process and provides better tooling and code quality.
- The app is styled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to make it easy to build custom, responsive designs without writing custom CSS.
- Additionally, the use of external UI libraries such as [SemanticUI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [AceternityUI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) enhances the experiences of our website. These might be subject to change later due to performance and SEO.
